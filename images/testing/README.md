# Testing Our Implementation

We tested our implementation against another online seam carving tool to verify that our results do produce satisfiable results.

We tested our implementation results against https://trekhleb.dev/js-image-carver/, and the results are in this folder.

The images named `{name}` are the original images

The images named `{name}_renamed_{#}_{#}` are the results returned from our implementation.

The images named `{name}_trekhleb_{#}_{#}` are the results returned in the online tool.

All attributions are listed in the repo's main README
