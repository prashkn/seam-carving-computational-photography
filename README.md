# Seam Carving Implementation

Resizing images using the seam carving algorithm.

## How To Run

Go through the jupyter notebook, `seam_carving.ipynb` to walk through our final project. We use functions in `utils.py`.

The notebook will prompt you to upload an image, and specify the width and height percentages.
